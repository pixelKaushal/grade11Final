          <h1>7.1 Introduction to Multimedia</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Multimedia</strong> refers to the integration of multiple
            forms of media, such as <strong>text</strong>,
            <strong>graphics</strong>, <strong>audio</strong>,
            <strong>video</strong>, and <strong>animation</strong>, to create
            engaging and interactive content. It is a powerful tool for
            communication, education, entertainment, and information
            dissemination. The term "multimedia" is derived from two words:
            "multi," meaning many, and "media," meaning the means of
            communication.

          <h1>7.2 Components of Multimedia</h1>
          <p>
            Multimedia consists of five main components, each playing a unique
            role in creating a rich and engaging experience:
          </p>
          <h3>1. Text</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Text</strong> is the written content used to convey
            information. It is the most basic and essential component of
            multimedia. Text provides context, explanations, and instructions.
            It can be styled using fonts, sizes, and colors to enhance
            readability and visual appeal.
          </p>
          <div class="animated-text">This is an example of animated text!</div>

          <h3>2. Graphics</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Graphics</strong> include images, icons, illustrations, and
            diagrams. They make content more visually appealing and help convey
            complex ideas in a simple and understandable way. Graphics are
            widely used in websites, presentations, and advertisements.
          </p>

          />

          <h3>3. Audio</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Audio</strong> refers to sound elements such as music,
            voiceovers, and sound effects. Audio enhances the user experience by
            adding depth and emotion to the content. It is commonly used in
            videos, podcasts, and video games.

          <h3>4. Video</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Video</strong> is a sequence of moving visual content that
            combines images and audio. Videos are highly effective for
            storytelling, demonstrations, and tutorials. They are widely used in
            entertainment, education, and marketing.

          <h3>5. Animation</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Animation</strong> involves creating motion and shape
            changes in visual elements. Animations make content more engaging

          <h3>1. Education</h3>
          <p>
            Multimedia is widely used in education to create interactive
            learning experiences. E-learning platforms use videos, animations,
            and simulations to explain complex concepts. For example, a biology
            lesson might include a video of a cell dividing or an interactive
            diagram of the human body.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Entertainment</h3>
          <p>
            The entertainment industry relies heavily on multimedia. Movies,
            video games, and music videos use a combination of text, graphics,
            audio, video, and animation to create immersive experiences. For
            example, video games use 3D graphics and sound effects to create
            realistic environments.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Advertising</h3>
          <p>
            Advertisements use multimedia to attract attention and convey

            highlighting its features.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Communication</h3>
          <p>
            Multimedia enhances communication by making it more interactive and
            engaging. Video conferencing, social media, and presentations use
