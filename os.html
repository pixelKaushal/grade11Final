          <h2>4. What is Memory Management in an Operating System?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
              <p>Memory Management is a function of the OS that manages the computer's memory resources. It allocates memory to processes, keeps track of memory usage, and ensures that one process does not interfere with the memory of another process.</p>
              <p>The main memory management techniques include:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><b>Contiguous Memory Allocation</b>: Assigns a single contiguous block of memory to a process.</li>
                  <li><b>Paging</b>: Divides memory into fixed-size pages and divides processes into pages for non-contiguous allocation.</li>
                  <li><b>Segmentation</b>: Divides memory into variable-sized segments, such as code, data, and stack segments.</li>
                  <li><b>Virtual Memory</b>: Uses a portion of the hard drive as if it were additional RAM, allowing the system to handle larger programs.</li>
              </ul>

          <h2>5. What is File Management in an Operating System?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
              <p>File Management is the part of the operating system responsible for organizing, storing, and retrieving files. It provides an interface for users and programs to interact with files on storage devices.</p>
              <p>The key components of file management include:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><b>File System</b>: A method for organizing files on storage devices, such as FAT, NTFS, or ext4.</li>
                  <li><b>File Operations</b>: Includes creating, reading, writing, deleting, and renaming files.</li>
                  <li><b>File Access Methods</b>: Defines how data is accessed in files, such as sequential or direct access.</li>
                  <li><b>Directories</b>: Structures used to organize files into hierarchical folders or directories.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>File management ensures efficient storage and retrieval of files, allowing users to organize data effectively.</p>

          <h2>6. What is a Deadlock in an Operating System?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
              <p>A deadlock is a situation in an operating system where two or more processes are unable to proceed because they are each waiting for the other to release a resource. Deadlock can lead to a system halt or indefinite waiting.</p>
              <p>The four conditions for a deadlock are:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><b>Mutual Exclusion</b>: Resources cannot be shared between processes.</li>
                  <li><b>Hold and Wait</b>: Processes holding resources are waiting for additional resources.</li>
                  <li><b>No Preemption</b>: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from processes.</li>
                  <li><b>Circular Wait</b>: A circular chain of processes exists where each process is waiting for a resource held by the next process in the chain.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Deadlock prevention, avoidance, and detection techniques are used to handle deadlock situations.</p>
